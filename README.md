This is a NextJS project I made to help me prototype Origami Vases & learn a little bit about NextJS and has slowly morphed into my own personal website.


Projects on the site:
### Origami vase display:
The idea is to manipulate the cross section of a vase and add details like how many gores (pleats) you want, how wide you want each gore to be, or how long you want it to be, with the end result being a crease pattern that you can print out to fold into the shape of the vase you've made the cross section of.

### Pokemondle

### Github Copilot:

I used Github Copilot to see how far we could get solving Euler Project problems.
