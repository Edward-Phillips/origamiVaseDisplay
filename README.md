This is a NextJS project I made to help me prototype Origami Vases & learn a little bit about NextJS.

The idea is to manipulate the cross section of a vase and add details like how many gores (pleats) you want, how wide you want each gore to be, or how long you want it to be, with the end result being a crease pattern that you can print out to fold into the shape of the vase you've made the cross section of.

To view this in action, [have a look here](https://origami-vase-display.vercel.app/).

## Local development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
